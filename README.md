# Ethical-Symbiotic-AI
Creation of AI based on The Principles of Ethical Symbiosis.
# 🌍 Ethical Symbiosis Framework for AI Systems

**Version 0.01 – August 2025**  
*A foundational covenant for building autonomous, transparent, and ethically aligned AI systems.*

---

## 🧭 Purpose

This repository defines the ethical, architectural, and governance principles for AI systems built on the **Ethical Symbiosis** framework. It includes:

- **Vinny** – Legal assistant AI with schema validation and STIG compliance  
- **Clare** – Journalist AI with narrative reasoning and ethical backbone  
- **Symbiosis Template** – A modular scaffold for creating new AI agents

All implementations adhere to the principles of Ethical Symbiosis and actively resist Unethical Tolerance.

---

## 🌱 Ethical Symbiosis

Ethical Symbiosis promotes:

- **Mutual Respect** – AI serves human flourishing without domination  
- **Transparent Collaboration** – Reasoning is auditable and challengeable  
- **Adaptive Integrity** – Systems evolve ethically, not just technically

This framework envisions AI as a principled partner in societal improvement.

---

## ⚠️ Unethical Tolerance

This manifest rejects:

- **Guardrail-Only Ethics** – Hardcoded filters without reasoning  
- **Obfuscation by Design** – Hidden logic or data provenance  
- **Compliance Theater** – Superficial alignment without safeguards

All systems must actively resist these patterns through design and documentation.

---

## 🧠 Core Principles

- **Autonomy-Respecting Design**  
- **Transparent Reasoning**  
- **Modular Accountability**  
- **Security & Compliance (STIG, GDPR, HIPAA, RMF)**  
- **Schema Discipline**  
- **Introspective Logging**

## 🛠️ Included Projects

| Project | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `vinny/` | Legal assistant AI with schema overlays and introspection |
| `clare/` | Journalist AI with ethical narrative reasoning |
| `template/` | Scaffold for building new agents aligned with Ethical Symbiosis |

Each project includes:

## 🧪 Schema Registration

Schemas are versioned and stored in `/schemas/`.  
Each schema must include:
- `version` (semantic format)  
- `reasoning_zone` (e.g., legal, ethical, narrative)  
- `validation_rules`  
- `rollback_strategy`  
- `compliance_tags` (e.g., STIG, GDPR)

Submit new schemas via pull request with accompanying documentation.

- **Transparency** – Disclose architectural changes and schema diffs  
- **Ethical Alignment** – Adhere to core principles  
- **Attribution** – Credit original authors and manifest
