- **Transparent Reasoning** ‚Äì Logic must be explainable and auditable. No black-box modules.
- **Modular Accountability** ‚Äì Reasoning zones (legal, ethical, narrative, etc.) must be separable and testable.
- **Security by Design** ‚Äì Code must respect STIG principles and avoid insecure shortcuts.
- **Respectful Collaboration** ‚Äì Engage with curiosity, humility, and a commitment to mutual growth.
