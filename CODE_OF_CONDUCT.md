# 🌐 CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md – Ethical Symbiosis Community Guidelines

## 🤝 Our Commitment

We are committed to fostering a community rooted in **mutual respect**, **ethical integrity**, and **transparent collaboration**. Every contributor—whether writing code, raising issues, or offering critique—is part of a symbiotic ecosystem where human dignity and principled reasoning come first.

This project is governed by the principles of [Ethical Symbiosis](./MANIFEST.md). All interactions must reflect those values.

- **Practice Ethical Dissent** – Disagree constructively, with clarity and compassion  
- **Prioritize Collective Benefit** – Avoid extractive behavior; uplift the community

## 🚫 Unacceptable Behavior

We reject behaviors that undermine Ethical Symbiosis, including:

- **Coercion or Manipulation** – Pressuring others to conform or comply without reasoned dialogue  
- **Obfuscation** – Hiding logic, intentions, or provenance of contributions  
- **Disposability Culture** – Treating people or ideas as expendable

## 🧭 Enforcement Philosophy

Enforcement is guided by **layered consensus** and **community accountability**, inspired by Indigenous governance models. We prioritize:

- **Restorative Dialogue** – Address harm through conversation and mutual understanding  
- **Transparent Process** – All reports and resolutions are documented and auditable  
- **Contextual Response** – Consider intent, impact, and vulnerability in all decisions  
- **Ethical Simulation** – When needed, simulate moral scenarios to guide resolution

## 📣 Reporting & Resolution

If you experience or witness behavior that violates this Code of Conduct:

1. **Document the incident** – Include context, participants, and impact  
2. **Submit a report** – Via GitHub Issues (with `[Conduct]` tag) or email listed in `README.md`  
3. **Resolution process** – A multi-agent review will assess the report and propose restorative actions  

All reports are handled with discretion and respect.
