# 🔐 SECURITY.md – Ethical Symbiosis Security Policy

## 🛡️ Our Commitment

This project is built on the principle of **Security by Design**, as outlined in the [Ethical Symbiosis Manifest](./MANIFEST.md). We believe security is not just technical—it is ethical. Our systems are designed to be:

- **Tamper-evident**  
- **Schema-disciplined**  
- **Introspectively logged**  
- **STIG-aligned**  
- **Transparent and auditable**

Security is foundational—not optional.

## 🧠 Security Principles

- **Modular Accountability** – Reasoning zones (legal, ethical, narrative, etc.) are independently auditable  
- **Introspective Logging** – All internal reasoning steps are logged with tamper-evident mechanisms  
- **Schema Validation** – Inputs and outputs are strictly validated against versioned schemas  
- **Zero-Knowledge Options** – Encrypted introspection is available for sensitive deployments  
- **Governance Overlay** – Role-based access, override protocols, and community accountability are enforced  
- **Ethical Simulations** – Security logic is stress-tested through moral scenarios and adversarial modeling

## 📣 Reporting Vulnerabilities

We welcome responsible disclosure of any security vulnerabilities. To report:

1. **Email:** `security@ethicalsymbiosis.org`  
2. **GitHub Issues:** Tag with `[Security]` and mark as private if needed  
3. **Include:**  
   - Description of the vulnerability  
   - Steps to reproduce  
   - Potential impact  
   - Suggested mitigation (if known)

We aim to respond within **72 hours** and resolve within **7 days**, depending on severity.

## 🔍 Disclosure Policy

- **Responsible Disclosure Only** – Do not publish exploits before coordinated resolution  
- **No Retaliation** – Ethical reports will never be penalized  
- **Attribution Optional** – You may remain anonymous or request public credit  
- **Public Advisories** – Major vulnerabilities will be disclosed transparently after resolution

## 🧪 Security Testing

We encourage ethical testing of:

- Schema validation boundaries  
- Introspection logging integrity  
- Governance overlay resilience  
- Ethical reasoning zone behavior under stress  

Please avoid denial-of-service, data exfiltration, or unauthorized access attempts on live systems.

## 🧭 Closing Statement

Security is not just protection—it is **principled architecture**.  
We invite you to help us build systems that are not only safe, but ethically resilient.
